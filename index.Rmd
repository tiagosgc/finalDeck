## Guess the number

My assignment is not an analysis _per se_, but I hope it is fun to try out

--- .class #id 

## Summary

In this interface you're playing a game of guessing a random generated number between 1 and 100

---

## Why 7 tries?

If you eliminate half of the possible numbers in each try, you should always be able to guess in 7 tries


---

## Some code to demonstrate my point

```{r, eval=FALSE}
n<-100
i<-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
for (val in i) {
    n <- ceiling(n/2)
    print(paste(c("Iteration ", val,
        ", number of possible answers reduced to ",
        n),collapse = ''))
    
}

```

---

## And the same code output

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo =FALSE, comment=''}
n<-100
i<-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
for (val in i) {
    n <- ceiling(n/2)
    print(paste(c("Iteration ", val,
        ", # possible answers = ",
        n),collapse = ''))
    
}

```
